# Research Project Guideline

2025.11.06

**1. Choosing Your Topic**

You can choose any topic related to computer vision for your research project. It can be either belong or beyond the course scope. You can explore a new project, **reproduce an existing CV paper**, or **extend your own research project**. For paper reproduction, please try to make some improvement and explain it in your project report. You are required to send an abstract of your project to the TAs (Teaching Assistants) for **confirmation** of your topic.

The project group is the same as the paper reading group. You should finish the project with your group members together. Please fill in your project information [here](#).

**2. Coding**

We recommend Python as the coding language, and PyTorch as the framework if any deep learning architectures are involved.

**3. Presentation**

**The project presentation will be held on (18-Dec) and (25-Dec).** Each group will be required to make an ENGLISH presentation on your research project. The presentation should contain:

*   Introduction to your topic,
*   Background and related works,
*   What you have done,
*   What you plan to do in the future, *etc.*

Each group will have around 20 minutes to present, including 15 minutes for project presentation and 5 minutes for QA (from both students and professors).

**4. Report**

Each group is required to submit a formal research report to Teaching Assistants. The report should contain:

*   <span style="color:red">Bio and contribution of each group member,</span>
*   Introduction to your topic,
*   Background and related works,
*   Proposed methods,
*   Experimental results and analysis,
*   Your codes, *etc.*

For the text template, we recommend the NeurIPS LaTex template [here](#). English is required.

For the code, either a GitHub link or a zip file is fine. Note that a detailed README file containing steps to run your codes (*e.g.* how to install dependencies, how to train/inference) is requested.

The deadline for submission is 2026.01.25 24:00. There will be no extension.

**5. Grading Policy**

The research project composites 50% of your final grade.

Level-0 (basic requirement): The project is relatively complete and your codes are runnable. If you reproduce an existing paper, there should be some improvement. The project presentation and report are clear.

Level-1 (basic requirement): The project is complete and there are some new designs from your group. Clear coding logic and detailed README files for the TAs to reproduce all your results. The project presentation and report are clear and detailed.

Level-2 (highly recommended): The project is complete and there are some novel design from your group. The topic is important and interesting. The proposed method is innovative. The experiments are extensive. The conclusion is inspiring. The project presentation and report are well organized and written.

Level-3 (optional): The proposed method innovatively distinguishes from existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results. The project report reaches the paper publication standard.
